"faceHappiness" is an Android library that provides a custom view to display a smiley face with animated eyes and mouth. The view can be customized to adjust the size and color of the elements, as well as the happiness level displayed by the face. It also provides a listener interface to send events when the user interacts with the view.

This library is useful for developers who want to add a fun and engaging element to their Android applications, especially those related to mood tracking, social media, or games. It is easy to integrate into existing projects, and the code is well-documented and open-source for further customization.

To use this library, simply add it as a dependency in your Android project and create a "Smile" view in your layout XML or programatically. You can then customize its attributes and set a listener to receive events when the user interacts with the view.
